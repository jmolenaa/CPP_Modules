# CPP Module 05

Module 05 explores the concepts of repetition and exceptions in C++. It focuses on designing robust and maintainable systems through exception handling, abstract classes, and inheritance. The exercises in this module simulate a bureaucratic workflow with forms, exceptions, and error management.

### **Learning Outcomes**
By completing this module, you will:
- Understand and implement exception handling in C++.
- Create abstract classes and derive specific implementations.
- Work with inheritance and polymorphism to design scalable systems.
- Develop error-prone processes that can handle exceptions gracefully.

| [**Exercise 00: Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_05/ex00) | Introduces the `Bureaucrat` class with exception handling for invalid grades and operations.                       |
| [**Exercise 01: Form up, maggots!**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_05/ex01) | Adds the `Form` class, which includes validation for signing with appropriate exception handling.                   |
| [**Exercise 02: No, you need form 28B, not 28C...**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_05/ex02) | Implements an abstract `AForm` class with concrete derived forms, enhancing functionality and introducing execution. |
| [**Exercise 03: At least this beats coffee-making**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_05/ex03) | Adds the `Intern` class, which can dynamically create forms based on string input, avoiding rigid `if-else` chains.  |
