# CPP Module 03

C++ Module 03 introduces inheritance, a cornerstone of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The exercises focus on building class hierarchies, understanding constructor and destructor chaining, and exploring the principles of reusability and extensibility in OOP.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this module, you will learn:
- The fundamentals of inheritance in C++.
- How to create and manage class hierarchies.
- Proper implementation of constructors, destructors, and function overriding.
- Utilizing and extending base class functionality in derived classes.
