# CPP_Modules

The CPP_Modules are a comprehensive set of modules split into topics and exercises that introduce you to the CPP language and to OOP concepts. It aims to teach you these skills so you can use them in different languages and to become better at CPP.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these modules you will learn:
- The basics of CPP and some of the functionality that is added compared to C
- OOP concepts and how to setup basic classes

## Table of Contents

There are in total 10 modules, each introducing a new concept so that you can gradually learn the language
