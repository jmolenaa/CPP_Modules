# CPP Module 08
 
Module 08 delves into templated containers, iterators, and algorithms, focusing on leveraging the Standard Template Library (STL) to write efficient and reusable code. The exercises emphasize the use of templates, iterators, and STL algorithms to solve problems effectively.

### **Learning Outcomes**
By completing this module, you will:
- Understand and implement function and class templates in C++.
- Utilize STL containers like `vector`, `list`, and `map` effectively.
- Leverage STL algorithms for common operations on containers.
- Gain hands-on experience with iterators and their integration into custom container-like structures.
- Implement reusable and iterable custom data structures using STL.

| [**Exercise 00: Easy find**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_08/ex00)   | Implements a templated function to find an integer in a container, using STL algorithms for simplicity and efficiency. |
| [**Exercise 01: Span**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_08/ex01)       | Develops a class to calculate the shortest and longest spans between numbers in a container, demonstrating range-based operations. |
| [**Exercise 02: Mutated abomination**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_08/ex02) | Extends `std::stack` to create an iterable custom container, combining stack functionality with iterator support.    |
