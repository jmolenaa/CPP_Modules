# CPP Module 01

C++ Module 01 focuses on memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and the switch statement. This module continues your journey into C++ by diving deeper into its unique features.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this module, you will learn:
- Memory management and the differences between heap and stack allocation.
- Effective use of pointers to members and references for addressing and object manipulation.
- File manipulation and string replacement using standard C++ functionality.
- Leveraging the switch statement for control flow in log filtering.
