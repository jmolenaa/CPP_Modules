# CPP Module 02

C++ Module 02 dives deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with a focus on ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and adhering to the Orthodox Canonical Class Form. The exercises emphasize memory management, code organization, and advanced class functionality.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this module, you will learn:
- How to apply ad-hoc polymorphism (operator overloading) effectively.
- The structure and implementation of the Orthodox Canonical Class Form.
- Working with fixed-point numbers and basic geometric calculations.
