# CPP Module 04

### **Description**
Module 04 focuses on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. It introduces concepts critical to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract design. The exercises are designed to deepen your understanding of these principles through practical implementations.

### **Learning Outcomes**
By completing this module, you will:
- Understand and apply subtype polymorphism in C++.
- Design and implement abstract classes and interfaces.
- Manage memory effectively to avoid leaks when working with dynamic allocation.
- Practice the use of the Orthodox Canonical Form in class design.
- Understand deep versus shallow copies in object-oriented programming.

|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**Exercise 00: Polymorphism**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_04/ex00) | Introduces basic polymorphism using inheritance and virtual functions with an Animal class and its derived classes. |
| [**Exercise 01: I Donâ€™t Want to Set the World on Fire**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_04/ex01) | Adds a Brain class with dynamic allocation and tests deep copy implementation.                                     |
| [**Exercise 02: Abstract Class**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_04/ex02) | Modifies the Animal class to become abstract, ensuring it cannot be instantiated directly.                         |
| [**Exercise 03: Interface & Recap**](https://github.com/jmolenaa/CPP_Modules/tree/main/CPP_04/ex03) | Implements interfaces using pure abstract classes and tests concepts like cloning, inventory management, and Materia creation. |
